angular-bacon
=============

[bacon.js](https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js) bindings for [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js).

Make your AngularJS apps even more reactive, by using bacon.js FRP library to process your scope properties.

Usage
-----

Simply require *angular-bacon* in your AngularJS module, and both $rootScope and Bacon objects are augmented automatically with the following functions:

**$scope.$watchAsProperty(property)**

Exposes an AngularJS [scope](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope) property as a bacon.js [property](https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js#property). If the property already has a value in the scope (i.e. is not _undefined_), that value becomes the property's initial value.

**$scope.$watchCollectionAsProperty(property)**

Exposes an AngularJS [scope](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope) Array or Object property as a bacon.js [property](https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js#property). If the property already has a value in the scope (i.e. is not _undefined_), that value becomes the property's initial value.

This function is equivalent to `$scope.$watchAsProperty` but using `$watchCollection` instead of `$watch`, so that changes in Array and Object values are properly detected.

**$scope.eventAsStream(eventName)**

Exposes scope events as an EventStream.  The the stream value will be event object and any passed parameters as an array.

**Bacon.Observable.digest($scope, property)**

Digests a bacon.js observable (stream or property) back to an AngularJS scope property. Attaches an .onValue handler to the observable, which simply $applies the property in the selected scope with the selected key.

**$scope.digestObservables(observables)**

Digests multiple bacon.js observables at once. Simple syntactic sugar, when multiple observables are involved. _observables_ is a map with object keys representing $scope property names into which the observables are digested into.

Examples
--------

For examples, see [here](examples/form-validation.js). This example somewhat mimics raimohanska's [awesome](http://nullzzz.blogspot.fi/2012/11/baconjs-tutorial-part-ii-get-started.html) bacon.js [tutorials](http://nullzzz.blogspot.fi/2012/12/baconjs-tutorial-part-iii-ajax-and-stuff.html): it features a simple login validation form, where a slow backend "is-nickname-taken" check is simulated by a stream with a 5-second delay. In addition, the two selected passwords must match, and be at least five characters long before the submit button is enabled.
